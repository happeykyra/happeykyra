- 👋 Hi, I’m @happeykyra
- 👀 I’m interested on equality in life, for everyone, for everything;
  black people; culture and writting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning phyton(yes, the snakecode), how to draw and how to be a better person.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my projects: ?
- 📫 How to reach me: Be nice! 
- 😄 Pronouns: whatever you want to call me, just don't be cruel.
- ⚡ Fun fact: INTJ(in any case u know what it means); I'm studious and very serious about fullfiling my duties,
  but also someone really happy inside that lives everyday in peace willing to keep life good for both me, Earth and universe.
